One way to characterize user's audio aura is to calculate average energy, valence, and danceability of a personâ€™s top 100 songs from the past year.
It might not full correctly represent user's aura because it may favour more popular or newer songs and not reflect the actual musical preferences of the general public.
One thing to improve this method is to consider using a larger dataset.
