## Description

**BudoRent** is a mobile-responsive web application designed to streamline the rental process for construction equipment. Users can browse a variety of tools, reserve them for pickup, manage their rental history, and interact with the service through a user-friendly interface. The app is intended for individuals and companies that need temporary access to tools such as drills, screwdrivers, and ladders, without the necessity of purchasing them.

The app was built using **Flask (Python)** as the backend framework, **HTML/CSS** for the frontend, and **SQL** to handle data storage. It is designed to be simple and intuitive, enabling easy navigation and functionality for both desktop and mobile users.

## Key Features

### 1. **User Authentication**
Users can create an account with a secure registration system and log in to manage their profile and rentals. The authentication system ensures that user data, such as rental history and personal information, is stored securely.

### 2. **Equipment Catalog**
The application features an extensive catalog of construction equipment, allowing users to browse tools available for rent. Each tool has a dedicated page with details such as availability, price, rental terms, and a short description.

### 3. **Reservation System**
Once users find the equipment they need, they can add it to their **Cart** and proceed to reserve it. The system allows users to specify the rental duration and choose a pickup date. All reservations are stored in the database, and users receive confirmation of their bookings.

### 4. **User Account Management**
After logging in, users can access their **Profile** page, where they can:
- View and update their personal information.
- Review their **Rental History**, which shows a list of all past and current reservations.
- Manage reservations, such as canceling or modifying an upcoming rental.

### 5. **Cart**
The **Cart** allows users to store the equipment they plan to rent temporarily. Users can adjust the quantity of tools or remove items before proceeding to the reservation process. The cart provides an overview of all selected items, including pricing and estimated total costs for the rental.

### 6. **Contact Page**
The **Contact** page allows users to reach out for support or inquiries. They can fill out a contact form to ask questions about the service or report any issues. The page also displays company contact details, including phone numbers and email addresses for customer support.

   - After completing the reservation, the user can view it on their **Profile** page under **Rental History**.

2. **Reservation System**:
   - When a user makes a reservation, the system checks the availability of the tools based on the selected dates.
   - The reservation details are stored in the SQL database, ensuring that the inventory is updated in real-time.

3. **Profile and History**:
   - The **Profile** page allows users to view their current and past reservations. They can cancel or modify upcoming rentals depending on the store's policies.
   - All rental transactions are securely logged in the SQL database, allowing users to keep track of their rental history for future reference.

4. **Contact Page**:
