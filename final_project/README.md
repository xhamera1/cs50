#### Description: For my CS50 final project, I created a mobile application called BudoRent using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL. The purpose of the app is to facilitate the rental of construction equipment, such as drills, screwdrivers, ladders, and other tools.
### Key Features:
-User Authentication: Users can create an account and log in securely to manage their rentals.
-Equipment Catalog: A variety of construction equipment is available for browsing, with details on availability and rental terms.
-Reservation System: Users can select items from the catalog and reserve them for pickup at a physical store location.
-User Account Management: Users have access to a personal dashboard where they can view their current and past reservations.
-Database Integration: All data, including user accounts, equipment inventory, and reservations, is managed using a SQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
### Technologies Used:
-** Flask (Python): Backend framework to handle routing, user authentication, and database interaction.
-HTML/CSS: Frontend development for designing a clean, user-friendly interface.
-SQL: Database management to store user data, equipment listings, and reservations.
-Mobile-Responsive Design: The app is designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices, providing a smooth user experience.
-This project demonstrates my understanding of web development, database management, and user authentication systems. BudoRent offers a practical solution for those who need access to construction tools without the need for purchasing them, making it a convenient service for both businesses and individual users.
