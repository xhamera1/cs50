#### Description:
**BudoRent** is a web application developed for renting construction equipment such as drills, ladders, and other tools. The application allows users to browse equipment, make reservations, and manage their rental history.

Key features include:
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and registration.
- **Equipment Catalog**: View available tools with detailed information.
- **Reservation System**: Users can reserve items and schedule pickups.
- **User Dashboard**: View and manage current and past rentals.
- **Database Integration**: Efficient data storage using SQL.

The project was built using **Flask** (Python), **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SQL** to ensure smooth functionality and a mobile-friendly design.

This project showcases my skills in web development, user authentication, and database management.
