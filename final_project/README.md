## Description
For my CS50 final project, I created a mobile application called **BudoRent** using **Flask**, **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **SQL**. The purpose of the app is to facilitate the rental of construction equipment, such as drills, screwdrivers, ladders, and other tools.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Users can create an account and log in securely to manage their rentals.
- **Equipment Catalog**: A variety of construction equipment is available for browsing, with details on availability and rental terms.
- **Reservation System**: Users can select items from the catalog and reserve them for pickup at a physical store location.
- **User Account Management**: Users have access to a personal dashboard where they can view their current and past reservations.
- **Database Integration**: All data, including user accounts, equipment inventory, and reservations, is managed using a SQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask (Python)**: Backend framework to handle routing, user authentication, and database interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend development for designing a clean, user-friendly interface.
- **SQL**: Database management to store user data, equipment listings, and reservations.
- **Mobile-Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on mobile devices, providing a smooth user experience.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my understanding of web development, database management, and user authentication systems. **BudoRent** offers a practical solution for those who need access to construction tools without purchasing them, making it a convenient service for both businesses and individual users.
