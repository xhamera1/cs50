sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: This algorithm performs exceptionally well on sorted arrays but is less efficient on random and reversed arrays.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: This algorithm, with an O(nlogn) complexity for both worst and average cases,
    performs the fastest on random and reversed arrays and shows similar efficiency on sorted and unsorted arrays.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Not very quick algorithm, it performs the worst on already sorted arrays.
